## ðŸ’¡ AI Agent Specific Instructions

### Task Execution Order
1. **Always complete Short Term tasks before Medium Term**
2. **Dependencies must be resolved before dependent tasks**
3. **Test infrastructure (ST-012) should be completed early**
4. **Documentation tasks can be executed in parallel with development**

### Code Generation Guidelines
- **Follow the established package structure**
- **Use TypeScript strict mode**
- **Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation**
- **Generate corresponding test files**
- **Follow the coding conventions from project instructions**

### Quality Gates
- **Each task must include unit tests**
- **Documentation must be updated**
- **Performance impact must be measured**
- **Backward compatibility must be maintained during transitions**

This board provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming 39.ts into the definitive Neutralino.js framework, with clear deliverables, dependencies, and success criteria for both human and AI development.
